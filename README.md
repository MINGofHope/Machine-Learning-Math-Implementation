## SVM

## Folder Explanations 
- Math Notes: the math behind classical machine algorithms
- Code: their python implementation 
- Ex: test for the concepts understanding and supplement prove for details
  - Homework_# and Sol_# are couple, though some Sol file has been combined into Homework_# directly
  - In_Class_Problem # are as the supplement prove for details metioned in the math notes. 
- Projects: <span style="color:red">Cooperation in process</span>.
